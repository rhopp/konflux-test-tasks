# Changelog

<!-- Format guidelines: https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/#how -->

## 0.3.5

### Changed

- Detect nested archives with a long-lived libarchive reader instead of
  starting `bsdtar` for every file. Extract archives concurrently while
  preserving content-based detection and falling back to the previous serial
  extractor if the accelerated detector is unavailable.

## 0.3.4

### Added

- Pre-extract every nested archive into a loose file tree before scanning, so
  clamd scans each file directly instead of recursing through nested archive
  layers. This makes scanning of deeply nested archives faster. Extraction uses
  `bsdtar`, which detects archives (zip/jar/war/ear/tar
  and tar.gz/tar.bz2/tar.xz) by content rather than extension — important because
  the OCI `dir:` payload is an extension-less blob — and unpacks them
  unconditionally with no size/count/depth limits. It is defensive: a corrupt or
  partial archive is left in place for clamd rather than aborting the scan. No new
  parameters are introduced. Requires the `clamav-db` image to ship `bsdtar`
  (added in konflux-clamav).

## 0.3.3

### Changed

- Skip downloading OCI layers whose manifest annotations name only unscannable
  model-weight files (`.safetensors`, `.gguf`, `.ggml`, `.pt`, `.pth`, `.onnx`,
  `.onnx_data` / `.onnx_data_*`), using `org.opencontainers.image.title` and
  `olot.layer.content.inlayerpath`. Any other annotated layer is skipped when
  the OCI descriptor `size` is at least 2000MiB (slightly under ClamAV's ~2GiB
  MaxFileSize), regardless of extension. Layers without those annotations are
  still listed with `--dry-run` as in 0.3.2. The `--dry-run` skip uses the
  same name list.

## 0.3.2

### Added

- Skip extracting OCI layers that contain only unscannable model-weight files
  (`.safetensors`, `.gguf`, `.ggml`). Other layers are still extracted and
  scanned. If layer listing fails, the task falls back to extracting the
  full image.

## 0.3

### Changed

- Replaced clamscan with clamdscan for parallel scanning support.
- Added `image-arch` parameter for multi-architecture builds.
- Added `clamd-max-threads` parameter with default of 8 threads.

## 0.2

### Changed

- Removed sidecar from the task; required tools added to the ClamAV container image.

## 0.1

### Added

- Initial version of the `clamav-scan` task.
